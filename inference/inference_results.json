The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.assistant\n\nThe answer is B.\n\nExplanation: To find which organism contains matter that was once part of the lichen, look at the arrows in the food web.\nThe arrow from the lichen points to the collared lemming. So, the collared lemming eats the lichen.\nThe arrow from the collared lemming points to the arctic fox. So, the arctic fox eats the collared lemming.\nThe arrow from the arctic fox points to the grizzly bear. So, the grizzly bear eats the arctic fox.\nThe arrow from the arctic fox points to the bilberry. So, the arctic fox eats the bilberry.\nThe arrow from the bilberry points to the earthworm. So, the earthworm eats the bilberry.\nThe arrow from the earthworm points to the barren-ground caribou. So, the barren-ground caribou eats the earthworm.\nThe arrow from the barren-ground caribou points to the mushroom. So, the mushroom eats the barren-ground caribou.\nLook at the arrows that point to the mushroom. One arrow comes from the barren-ground caribou. One arrow comes from the grizzly bear. Both the barren-ground caribou and the grizzly",
    "expected_answer": "B",
    "solution": "Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the lichen.\nNo arrow points to the bilberry. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the lichen to the bilberry."

    "question": "What is the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece? Choose the most likely ratio.\nA. 0:4\nB. 4:0\nC. 2:2\nD. 1:3\nE. 3:1\n\nHint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:\nThe fleece, or outer coat, of a sheep is often cut off and used to make yarn for fabrics and other textiles. Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets.\nIn a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.",

In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.assistant\n\nThe answer is A.\n\nExplanation: The question asks for the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece. So, you need to figure out how many of each trait are expected in the offspring.\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep. Both sheep have a woolly fleece. Both sheep are homozygous recessive for the fleece type trait. So, each sheep has two copies of the f allele.\nSo, every gamete each sheep makes will have the f allele. This means that every offspring will have two copies of the f allele. So, every offspring will have a woolly fleece.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0.",
    "expected_answer": "B",
    "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.\nA woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.\nA hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairy fleece."

All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.assistant\n\nThe answer is A.\n\nExplanation: The magnets in Pair 1 and Pair 2 are the same distance apart. But the magnets in Pair 1 are touching. The magnets in Pair 2 are not touching.\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force between magnets depends on the distance between them. When the magnets are touching, the distance between them is 0. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are touching.\nBut the magnets in Pair 1 and Pair 2 are not the same size. The magnitude of the magnetic force also depends on the size of the magnets. Imagine two pairs of magnets that are the same distance apart. The magnets in one pair are bigger than the magnets in the other pair. The bigger magnets will pull or push on each other more. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force will be greater.\nIn this situation, the magnets in Pair 1 and Pair 2 are the same distance apart. But the magnets in Pair 1 are touching. They are also bigger than the magnets in Pair 2. These two changes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force in different ways. But the changes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force by the same amount. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs",
    "expected_answer": "C",
    "solution": "Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.\nMagnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."
